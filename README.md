# CDS-App-using-GSM and PIC16 Microchip Family
This Git repository contains the source code and project files for a robust and efficient Car Intrusion Detection System. Developed using microcontrollers from the PIC 16 Family and integrated with GSM technology, this system aims to detect and alert car owners about potential intrusions while their vehicles are parked


Features:

Utilizes advanced microcontrollers from the PIC 16 Family for precise and reliable intrusion detection.
Integrates GSM technology for instant notifications via SMS or calls when an intrusion is detected.
Implements a comprehensive range of sensors to monitor key aspects of car security, including door openings, glass breakage, and motion detection.
Includes efficient power management techniques to optimize battery usage and ensure long-term functionality.
Provides a user-friendly interface for system configuration and monitoring, accessible through a dedicated mobile application or web-based interface.
Offers customizable alert settings, allowing users to define preferred notification methods and contact numbers.
Supports remote system management and control, enabling users to arm or disarm the system remotely.
Contains detailed documentation and instructions for hardware setup, software installation, and system integration.
